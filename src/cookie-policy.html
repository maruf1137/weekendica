									Cookies are text files generated by a website and placed on your computer or on
									any other device you are using to access the website. Cookies are used on this
									website for various purposes including, for example, to evaluate, develop and
									track website usage, improve the user experience and facilitate accommodation
									bookings, help your browser navigate through this website, and collect standard
									internet log information and visitor behaviour information. Cookies from third
									parties facilitate targeted marketing on this and other websites and they
									(including those set by Google Analytics Premium – see Section 2) are used to
									evaluate and compile statistical reports for us on website activity. Section 2 and
									the table below contain further details about the cookies used and their purposes.
									<br /><br />

									Most of the cookies on this website do not capture a user's name or other
									information that would identify the user personally. They merely identify a
									computer or other device. All information collected by cookies on this website is
									aggregated and therefore anonymous. <br /><br />

									However, some cookies operated by our technology providers (such as Google, Hotjar
									and Fresh Relevance) may collect certain personal information. Please see below
									for an explanation of how you can find out details on and manage these cookies.
									<br /><br />

									Information collected by the marketing cookies on this website will be disclosed
									to third parties. See the table below. <br /><br />

									Session cookies store information locally on your device for the duration of your
									visit and expire at the end of your browsing session, i.e. when you close your
									browser window the session, cookie and information it collected is deleted.
									Persistent cookies are stored on your computer or other device and they remain
									there after you close your session until you delete them manually or until your
									browser deletes them based on the pre-determined period contained within the
									persistent cookie's file. <br /><br />

									This website uses both first party and third party cookies, see the table below.
									Section 2 below contains detailed information about the use of third party cookies
									in particular marketing and analytics cookies. <br /><br />

									We have decided to categorise cookies used on our website based on the UK
									International Chamber of Commerce’s cookie guide, as follows:
								</p>
								<ul class="cookie-list mb-2">
									<li class="cookie-item">
										Cookies <strong>"strictly necessary"</strong> for functionality of this
										website’s platform. These cookies are essential in order to enable users to move
										around this website and use its features.
									</li>
									<li class="cookie-item">
										<strong>"Performance"</strong> cookies which collect information about how users
										navigate this website, for instance which pages users access most frequently.
										They identify how users interact with our website, find out which pages seem to
										hold people up, which pages are not used often, which pages take a long time to
										load, what pages users tend to visit and in what order. All of this helps us to
										refine and develop our website to try and make them more usable when a user
										visits us again in future.
									</li>
									<li class="cookie-item">
										<strong>"Functionality"</strong> cookies which allow this website to remember
										choices you make. For example, this can be the last date you’ve searched for or
										the last holiday you’ve viewed.
									</li>
									<li class="cookie-item">
										<strong>"Targeting or advertising"</strong> cookies used to deliver adverts
										relevant to an identified machine or other device (not a named or otherwise
										identifiable person) which are tailored to interests associated with the website
										activity tied to that machine or device. These cookies are also used to limit
										the number of times a user sees an advertisement as well as to help measure the
										effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They may also remember that this
										website has been visited from a device and share that information with marketing
										organisations. The marketing cookies on this website are operated by third
										parties with our permission. Marketing cookies are used to monitor from which
										advertising source a user was directed towards our website, so that we know
										whether it is worth us investing in that particular advertising source.
