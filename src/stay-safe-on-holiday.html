							Your safety and wellbeing are very important to us. That’s why we do our best to make
							sure your stay at each and every James Villa property is safe and trouble free. Please
							do be aware though that our villas need to meet the local standards and regulations of
							the country they are in. These might not always be the same as we expect in the UK, so
							we ask that you do take extra care while you’re on holiday. <br /><br />

							Before you go away we’ll send you your travel documents. Packed with useful
							information unique to each property, they’ll have the ‘need-to-knows’ about your
							villa, directions and in-resort contacts. They also include handy advice and guidance
							for staying safe while you’re on holiday, as well as local emergency services’ contact
							information.

							<h5 class="heading mb-2">Balcony Safety</h5>
							<p class="text">
								You can’t beat a hillside villa with panoramic views! That does mean however that
								low walls and balustrades, together with ladder-effect railing are a popular design
								feature, so as not to take away from the beautiful scenery. Please do then make sure
								that all of your party are made aware of any low walls/balconies as soon as you
								arrive, and that children are supervised and stopped from climbing railings and
								furniture. This goes without saying we know, but please don’t lean or sit on the
								balcony edges.

						<div class="condition__item mb-2">
							<h5 class="heading mb-2">beach Safety</h5>
							<p class="text">
								Beach days are one of the best parts of a sun holiday, but even the safest can be
								dangerous in certain weather conditions. When you get there scope out the beach
								signage and check for warning flags – ask what they mean if you need to. Never swim
								where a sign says not to. Some areas might be zoned off for jet boats or jet skis,
								others lifeguards may have marked as unsafe. Do also be aware of tides and currents.
								Keep a close eye on your children – don’t let them swim unsupervised, and as fun as
								the lilo is, save the inflatables for the pool at your villa, not the open water.
								Make sure when you’re taking a dip that you swim along the shore edge and not out to
								sea.

								We’ve all done it - walked straight into that closed, glass door! Please do take
								extra care on holiday, because in the bright sunlight - glorious as it is - it might
								not be obvious at a glance whether the windows or patio doors are open or closed.
								Glass doors overseas are not always made with toughened safety glass, as they’re not
								legally required in some countries.

								the most of these! It does mean though that the property grounds might have drops in
								places. Please make sure everyone travelling in your party, especially children,
								know where these are, and that kids are kept a close eye on in these areas.

							<h5 class="heading mb-2">Sustainable Tourism</h5>
							<p class="text">
								More and more people are travelling abroad every year. While this brings many
								benefits to everyone involved, there is also concern about the negative impacts on
								the environment and culture of holiday destinations. We’re well aware of the vital
								role the holiday industry has to play in sustaining and improving the environment,
								for many generations to come. That’s why our brochures and magazines are made from
								paper that has chain of custody certification, and ensures all wood is from
								sustainable, managed forestation. <br /><br />

								It’s also why we introduced the James Villas Green Scheme in 2016, offering holidays
								with more sustainable accommodation options that protect and respect their local
								environment, the people who work for them and their local communities. The scheme
								encourages owners and suppliers to take extra steps towards being kinder to the
								environment and rewards them for their achievements.
